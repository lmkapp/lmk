## Installation

LMK is distrubted as a python package, so you can install it using `pip`:
```bash
pip install 'lmkapp[jupyter,cli]'
```
If you only plan to use LMK for either notebooks or command-line scripts, you can remove the corresponding extra in the command above the reduce the amount of dependencies you need to install. See the [docs](https://docs.lmkapp.dev/docs/intro) for details.

## Support

If you have any problems using LMK, please open an issue on this repository or email [support@lmkapp.dev](mailto:support@lmkapp.dev) for help.
