# LMK Documentation

This is the documentation site for LMK. It is built using Docusaurus v2. In order to build, first install the necessary packages via `pnpm`:
```bash
pnpm install
```
Some of the docs are generated by the `python-client` package. If you want to generate those, following the instructions in the [python client readme](packages/python-client/README.md#development-installation).

To build the docs, run:
```bash
pnpm build
```

To run a development server for the docs, run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
